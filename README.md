Tableau Analysis

Overview of the Analysis: The purpose of this analysis will be to showcase the different datapoints and visualizations that the Citibike Data has afforded. My analysis specifcally shows some connnections between Citibike Usage, Gender Differences in Usage and Geographic Hotspots of locations. Through Tableau's story function, it was easy to create a flow of showcasing those findings in an interactive and intuitive way.

Results

Top Starting Locations: This is a map showcasing the Top Starting Locations around NYC based on the size of the markers.It gives a good idea of just exactly where to track the majority of Citibike Activity and can lend credence to expanding on these locations for the other findings that introduce Gender and Checkout Times.

Checkout Times for User: This graph showcases the checkout times for Users in NYC specifically for showcasing how often these public bikes are checked out for all customers and subscribers. It's useful to get an idea of how much time per checkout thes bikes are being used for numerous factors (repairs, rate of usage etc.)

Checkout Times for User (By Gender): This same graph breaks down those figures among available Gender data and showcase a high amount of usage amongst males for the relevant checkout time lengths. Useful in introducing the topic and data revolving around Gender that can be cited and used in the rest of the story.

Gender Breakdown: This pie chart quickly showcases the total amoung of Males, Females and undefined/unknown users for quick reference and making comparisons if needed with either the previous graph or the other graphs.

User Trips by Gender: The following Heatmap offers a significant amount of data with gender comparisons being possible, customers vs subscriber usage being available and lastly the days throughout the week that see the greatest usage. It really puts together the different findings from this story into a cohesive heatmap/table hybrid. I believe this is the most impressive and detailed graph from the challenge as it pieces together a lot of information without seeming overtly complex and bloated.

Trips by Weekday per Hour: For the final two points. I wanted to spotlight the Trips by Weekday in an hourly breakdown with a filter available to see the immense differences. This graph can be used to help support key decisions for maintenance, recognizing when bikes will most likely be checked out or Citibike's peak hours of usage.

Trips by Weekday per Hour (by Gender): The final Heatmap showcases the same information but within the Gendered data available to see the differences between the three available fields to further expand on the differences in usage. It was a good way of closing the loop on the gender research and data to cap off the story.

Summary

Overall the story I created kind of melded itself around usage, gender and geographic areas of interest. The descriptions for the graph I feel offer a decent idea of how the graphs can flow from one another and the main takeaways for the usage of the graphs as well. If I had time to create two other visualizations, I would love to get an idea of whether or not for Customers vs Subscribers, if there are specific startpoints or endpoints that differ from one another. Essentially it would help identify if conventional customers have different popular start points or end points compared to subscribers which could be useful for advertising to less populated areas where customers could be exposed to promotions to become subscribers. Lastly, another visualization I could think of is whether or not the bikeId's allow a visualization for how often certain bikes have been used compared to others for repairs, whether some bikes need to replaced due to over usage etc.
